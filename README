As of this writing there is (was? :)) no pure way of interfacing Reachability from Swift.

I wrote a simple bridge to enable this since all other implementations seemed to rely on polling.

1) Add a bridging header to your project: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/MixandMatch.html
2) Add SwiftReachability.h to your bridging header.
3) myCallback:ReachabilityCallbackClosure={( target: SCNetworkReachability! , flags: SCNetworkReachabilityFlags ) -> Void in ... }
4) setupReachability(host:String, callback: ReachabilityCallbackClosure );
setupReachability("www.apple.com",myCallback)
5) Add a "return" at end of myCallback to ensure return type matches "void"
